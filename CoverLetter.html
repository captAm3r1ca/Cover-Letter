                <p class="content"> Dear Motley Fool team, </p>

                <p class="content">I have wanted to be a part of the Motley Fool family ever since I went to a Code and Coffee event when I moved to Virginia. Luckily today, I am a second-year student at George Mason University getting my B.S. in Computer Science. But when I was getting back into computer science and looking for a community, I saw that there was this Code and Coffee meetup at The Motley Fool in Alexandria. Someone from the company gave an introduction to the group, explained the event, and gave some information about working at The Motley Fool.  After that description, I was  determined to find a way to be a part of that culture. So, when I saw on the website that there was a spot for a Webtech Developer Intern and a Linux Web Engineering Intern, I had to take my chance and give it a shot. While I am still a padawan in the technical skills below, I have some strengths that have helped me over the years:
                    <ul class = "skill-list">
                        <li> With years of customer service experience in various fields, I have learned how to talk with consumers in a way for the technical jargon to make sense for them.</li>
                        <br><li> My passion and determination for this field pushes me to be a quick and flexible learner. It drives me to go beyond my limits, to find the solution when one isnâ€™t presented to me. </li>
                        <br><li> Through conferences and school, I have gained some of the basic technical skills in Python, Web Developmnt,Git, Linux and Window commands, C++ and .Net </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p id = "second-paragraph" class="content" >As you can tell, I love Marvel and especially Captain America. Not only is it my nickname, but the character always stays true to his morals and values to get the job done. I have always related to him in that way and I believe The Motley Fool acts the same way. I can see that Motley Fool's core values are lived and practiced everyday, to not only help the clients they serve but to help the employees grow in their career and personal life. I strongly believe a lot of my values align with those that are at the Motely Fool, and I would be honored for an opportunity to help contribute to help the Motely Fool make the world invest better.  </p>
