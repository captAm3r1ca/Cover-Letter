                <p class="content"> Dear Red Edge team, </p>

                <p class="content">As I was getting to know the company, I was amazed at the first main page you see when going to the Red Edge site. It is so rewarding and exciting to see something that is put together with skills and teamwork that helps thousands of people. I am a second-year student at George Mason University getting my B.S. in Computer Science. If its a slogan or your mini mission statement, but I admire the "Digital Advocacy Done Right" saying Red Edge has on the site. Since I am newer to the industry, when I hear companies talk about their teams and clients, digital advocacy seems like an after thought. Not a leading idea to help shape the company and to help provide better services to their clients. That is what really caught my eye and why I wanted to apply to Red Egde. Once I saw that and read more about the company, I knew I would be honored to be in the web development intern role. While I am still developing my technical skills below, I have some strengths that have helped me over the years:
                    <ul class = "skill-list">
                        <li> With years of customer service experience in various fields, I have learned how to talk with consumers in a way for the technical jargon to make sense for them.</li>
                        <br><li> My passion and determination for this field pushes me to be a quick and flexible learner. It drives me to go beyond my limits, to find the solution when one isnâ€™t presented to me. </li>
                        <br><li> Through conferences and school, I have gained some of the basic technical skills in Python, Web Developmnt,Git, Linux and Window commands, C++ and .Net </li>
                    </ul></p>
                    <p id = "second-paragraph" class="content" >As you can tell, I love Marvel and especially Captain America. Not only is it my nickname, but the character always stays true to his morals and values to get the job done. I have always related to him in that way and I try to find places that share his qualities. I can see Red Edge's core values relate closely to my own. From the site it seems that Red Edge values not only help the clients, buy they serve but to help the employees grow in their career and personal life. It's that advocacy that I appreciate and I would love to be aaprt of that family. Thank you for your time and consideration for the Web Development intern role.  </p>
